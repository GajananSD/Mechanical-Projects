# Modes_Of_Vibration_3DOF_System
Experimented in course ME 351 (2023), IIT Gandhinagar.

This project explores the modes of vibration in a **three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) system**, demonstrating how three bead masses attached to strings oscillate under different conditions.

---

## 📌 Introduction
In structural dynamics, a **3DOF system** consists of three masses interconnected by elastic elements, allowing for multiple modes of vibration. This setup helps in understanding **natural frequencies, mode shapes, and system behavior under excitation**.

## 📊 Modes of Vibration
The system exhibits **three fundamental vibration modes**:
1. **Mode 1:** All masses move in phase.

2. **Mode 2:** Middle mass moves opposite to outer masses.

3. **Mode 3:** Complex movement with alternating displacements.
